# COMP 472 Assignment 1

Please note that we collaborated for our assignment 1 on Colab so to view our contribution history kindly refer to the colab links below.

To run the .ipynb files, there are two ways:

1. Run the files on colab using the below links:
- Download the penguin.csv and abalone.csv files into the sample_data directory in colab
- For the penguin dataset: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1b36U_t2UQCN-nV5BSUkhsZGT-7bMW64l?usp=sharing
- For the abalone dataset: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1T4uDQDgo5zehumEVgeN1yRM2Ea4MqZT3?usp=sharing

2. Run the .ipynb files locally:
- Download the the submission ZIP containing 2 files, one for the penguin and the other for abalone dataset
- Extract the ZIP folder to a suitable location
- Create a directory called "sample_data" and download the penguin.csv and abalone.csv files into this directory
- If Jupyter Notebook is not already installed, install it following the steps mentioned here: https://jupyter.org/install
- Open a terminal at the location of the extracted folder (cd into the extracted submission directory)
- Run the command "jupyter notebook"
This should allow to view and run the .ipynb files locally
